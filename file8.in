Artificial intelligence is Intelligence displayed by machines, in contrast with the natural intelligence (NI) 
displayed by humans and other animals. In computer science AI research is defined as the study of 
intelligent agents: any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance 
of success at some goal.[1] Colloquially, the term artificial intelligence is applied when a machine mimics 
cognitive functions that humans associate with other human minds, such as learning and problem solving.
